    <p> Samwise Gamgee is one of the main protagonists from the acclaimed series <cite><a 
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings">The Lord of the Rings.</a></cite>
    He starts as any hobbit does someone who seeks comfort rather than adveture. He is pulled into accompanying his best friend Frodo
Baggins on a mission across perilous lands to destroy a ring. Not just any ring, but a ring that could cause the world they live in to
fall apart. Through thick and thin, and through many dangerous tasks, Samwise, with Frodo, destroy the ring and saved the lands.</p>
<ul>
    <li>One reason Samwise is one of my favorite fictional characteres is his loyalty. Even if it means putting his life at risk, Samwise will
        do anything for his friends.
    </li>
    <li class="color"> Another reason he's my favorite is he never gives up. Even when Frodo is on the brink of giving up, Samwise carries him (literally) 
        up the last stretch of the mountain to secure their victory.
    </li>
    <li> One other reason is that he loves food. Much like all the other hobbits, food is one of his passions. He carries around cookware and
        cooks for his friends. Something I can relate too!
